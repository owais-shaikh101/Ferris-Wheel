# Ferris Wheel Animation

This repository contains an interactive **Ferris Wheel** animation built with HTML and CSS. The animation simulates the movement of a Ferris wheel, complete with rotating cabins and structural lines. It uses CSS keyframes to animate both the wheel's rotation and the dynamic color changes of the cabins.

## Features

- **Rotating Ferris Wheel**: The main wheel rotates continuously, simulating a realistic Ferris wheel motion.
- **Dynamic Cabins**: Six cabins are positioned around the wheel, each changing colors in a smooth animation cycle.
- **Responsive Design**: The wheel adjusts its size dynamically based on the viewport, with a maximum size limit.

## Files

- **index.html**: Contains the HTML structure for the Ferris wheel and its components.
- **styles.css**: Defines the visual styling and animations for the Ferris wheel, including the rotating motion and color-changing cabins.
